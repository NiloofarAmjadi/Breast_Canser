This project aims to predict breast cancer using machine learning models. 
It utilizes a dataset of breast cancer cases and applies the best trained model to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.
The project includes a Flask web application for interacting with the model, which is deployed on Heroku.
It used Use the breast cancer dataset (Breast_Cancer_Data.csv) (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original)
The app.py script contains a Flask web application that allows users to interact with the machine learning model.
Users can input data through a web form, and the application will return predictions based on the trained model.
